🚀 Zomato Sales Analysis: Key Insights & Discrepancies 📊

I recently analyzed a Zomato Sales Dashboard, uncovering some interesting trends in restaurant performance across multiple countries. Here are the key takeaways:

🔹 Average Rating: 📉 2.89 – Indicates a need for service and food quality improvements. Enhancing customer experience should be a priority.

🔹 Table Booking Trends: 🍽️ 89.89% of restaurants offer table booking, while 10.11% do not. Encouraging table reservations across all locations could boost customer convenience and revenue.

🔹 Online Delivery Adoption: 🚀 93.98% of restaurants offer online delivery, yet 6.02% do not. A small but significant gap—optimizing delivery services for the remaining restaurants can increase sales potential.

🔹 Restaurant Growth Trends: 📅 2018 saw the highest number of new restaurant openings, while previous years showed fluctuations. Understanding market demands can help maintain steady growth.

🔹 Geographical Insights: 🌍 The UK (80) and Brazil (60) lead in restaurant count, while Indonesia and New Zealand have fewer outlets. Expansion strategies should focus on underrepresented markets.

✅ Key Recommendations:
✔ Improve food quality and service to enhance customer ratings.
✔ Optimize delivery options for restaurants yet to adopt online orders.
✔ Expand in countries with lower restaurant presence to tap into new markets.
✔ Investigate fluctuating restaurant openings to maintain consistent growth.
